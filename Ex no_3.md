# EX 3 C program to find number of years based on principle,rate & simple interest.
## DATE: 17/5/25
## AIM:
To write a C program to find number of years based on principle,rate & simple interest.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2.Declare the variables.
3.Prompt the user to enter a value.
4.Read the value using scanf.
5.Calculate the number of years using the formula:
6.End .  

## Program:
#include <stdio.h> #include <math.h> int main() { float p,n,r,si,ci; scanf("%f%f%f", &p,&n,&r); si=((pnr)/100); ci=(p)*(pow((1+ r/100),n)); printf("Simple Interest = %0.2f\nCompound Interest = %0.2f", si,ci); return 0; }

## Output:
